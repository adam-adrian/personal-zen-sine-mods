# A Random Personal Zen(Sine) Mods

This repo contains my random mods that I made for personal use with [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine).

## Installation

### Using Sine

You can install all mods in this repository directly through **Sine** by adding the repository URL from Sine Mods setting:

```
adam-adrian/personal-zen-sine-mods
```

### Installing Individually

If you only want specific mods rather than the full collection, you can install them one by one. Simply copy the direct URL of the desired mod folder and add it into your Sine Mods setting.
Example:

```
https://github.com/adam-adrian/personal-zen-sine-mods/tree/main/[mod-folder-name]
```
Replace `[mod-folder-name]` with the name of the folder containing the mod you want.
